  The school section of OpenStudio is where you will define all of your operational parameters,
  resources and products for your organization.

  *** Before continuing, a note about Profiles ***
  Customers, Teachers and Employees are all profiles that will appear as customers
  in the customer list under Customers -> Customer List.  A teacher or an employee has an
  additional flag marked in the account of the profile you create.  This is particularly useful when
  students are also Teachers or support staff (employees) to the school.
  You will not create separate records for one person who has multiple roles, but
  rather modify their user account and add check boxes to the flags for the additional
  account types, or roles, that you wish the 'customer' to have.

  OpenStudio will detect email addresses that are already in use to prevent the creation of duplicate profiles.

  You must assign an access group to each new Teacher or Employee profile if you would like their account to be
  valid for login, otherwise the profile won't have any access permissions to use the back end (non customer facing side) of the system.
  A profile does not need to have an access group assigned if you are simply defining the profile for record keeping/scheduling
  and the person does not need to login and participate on the OpenStudio system.


1. Teachers
-------------

From School -> Teachers you can manage profiles who Teach at your school.  You need to define
at least one teacher before you will be able to schedule any classes.  In order to add
a teacher, click +ADD at the top right corner of the screen.  You will be presented with
popup where you need to enter the Teachers First Name, Last Name and email address.

If your Teacher was already an employee or customer in the system, you only need to check
that additional role in the Account tab of the profile.

After you have added a Teacher, you will need to click the gray NO box to turn it
into a green YES box under the column Classes if they will teach classes and under
Events if they will be teaching at events.  The default value for both is NO.
If you do not change the status to YES, you will not be able to assign the Teacher
to a Class if this setting has not been changed.

  Actions menu

    Fixed Rate Payments
      You can define default fixed rate payments as well as custom per class payments.
        * Please note there are also per attendance schedules available *

    Travel Allowance
      You can define travel reimbursements for a Teacher per Location if you wish to
      disburse an additional payment when the instructor teaches a class at that location.

    Assign Class types
      You can assign class types that a teacher is qualified to teach.  This is helpful
      for schedulers who will receive an alert that an instructor doesn't have a particular
      class type certification associated with their profile when assigning that teacher to a class.

    Edit
      By clicking on edit you will open edit profile page.

2. Employees
-------------

From School -> Employees, you can manage profiles who are support staff at your school.

In order to add an Employee, click +ADD at the top right corner of the screen.  You will be presented with
popup where you need to enter the Employee's First Name, Last Name and email address.

Clicking the square button to the right of the Profile name with a Pencil in it will open the Edit Profile page.
Clicking the square button to the right of the profile name with an X in it will remove the Employee flag from
