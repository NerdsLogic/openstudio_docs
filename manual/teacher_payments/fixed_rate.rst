Fixed rate
==========

Fixed rate payments allow setting a fixed rate for classes in selected school locations.
A default rate should be set for each teacher, where class specific rates can be set to override the default rate.
Travel allowance is entered by location, if a class is given in a selected location the travel allowance is added.
Consecutive classes won't generate travel allowance twice on the invoice. A class is seen as consecutive if the start time of the next class is within 30 minutes of the previous class on the same day.
