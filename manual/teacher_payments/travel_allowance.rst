Travel allowance
================

Travel allowance is entered by location, if a class is given in a selected location the travel allowance is added.
Consecutive classes won't generate travel allowance twice on the invoice. A class is seen as consecutive if the start time of the next class is within 30 minutes of the previous class on the same day. If OpenStudio finds consecutive classes, travel allowance is only added to the first class of the consecutive classes. 

Configuration

Travel allowance is set individually for each teacher & location.

#. Go to School - Teachers in the main menu
