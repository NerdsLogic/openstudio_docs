Right to be forgotten
======================

Under the new regulations businesses based in the EU no longer have the right to keep processing any personal data that is no longer relevant to original purposes for which the owner of the data gave his or her consent.

As a general assumption in the case of OpenStudio, personal data no longer relevant can be defined as data of customers who have had no activity in or dealings with your businesses after a given date.
To assist in cleaning up inactive customers, a new report has been added. Using this report you can first view a list of customers without activity after a given date and then continue to remove them.
