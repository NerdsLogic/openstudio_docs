Manage subscription credits
===========================

This page describes how to manage credits for customers subscriptions.

Configuring school subscriptions
--------------------------------
The following fields for a school subscription define credit behavior

1. Classes
2. Classes per
3. Reconciliation classes
4. Credits validity (days)

**Classes & Classes per**
Classes define the numer of classes a week or month. When classes are defined per week, OpenStudio will automatically calculate the right number of credits for a month when giving out credits.
*Example: 1 class a week for a month with 31 days would be 4.4 credits*

**Reconciliation classes**
Like in the example above, some months might have 5 Mondays, so 4.4 credits isn't enough. The field *Reconciliation classes* allows you to define now many negative credits a customer can accumulate on this subscription. Or in other words, how many classes customers can attend on this subscription without having credits.
Looking at a whole year, customers will get enough credits, but might have a temporary shortage depending on the number of Mondays, Thuesdays, etc. in a month. 

**Credits validity (days)**
Number of days subscription credits will be valid. 


Adding credits for all subscriptions
------------------------------------
After settings the fields above for all appropriate subscriptions under school and adding subscriptions to customers, it's possible to add credits to all subscriptions in one go.
